# NextAuth unstable_getServerSession Issue in API Route

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using `unstable_getServerSession` from the NextAuth.js library within a Next.js API route.  The problem manifests primarily in development mode, where the session object is sometimes undefined, leading to unexpected behavior in API route handlers.

## Problem Description

The core issue is an improper handling of the request and response objects (`req` and `res`) within the API route context.  The `unstable_getServerSession` function relies on these objects being fully initialized. During development, this isn't always guaranteed, leading to cases where the session is `undefined` despite successful authentication.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the API route correctly utilizes the `req` and `res` objects and handling potential edge cases that might lead to the `undefined` session. This might involve error handling or restructuring how the authentication logic interacts with the API route.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Observe that the API route sometimes returns an unauthorized status (401) in development.
